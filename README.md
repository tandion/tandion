Hi, I'm Andreas Tretbar.
I'm currently learning in geomagnetics.
I was lucky enough to gain an insight into the world of the earth's magnetic field and have been fascinated by this type of field and its measurement ever since.
This will be my attempt to determine this field with sufficient precision using the simplest means.
I am open to ideas and suggestions. :-)
